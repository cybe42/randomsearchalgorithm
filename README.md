<p>This is a one big mess, I do not know what I am doing.</p>
<p>I do not recommend you to use this code in any way.</p>
<p>(except the string distance function which I basically just implemented in Rust myself in a poorly way. If you really came for that, Just use <a href="https://github.com/dguo/strsim-rs">strsim-rs</a> instead)</p>
<p>This was just an attempt to learn Rust.</p>
